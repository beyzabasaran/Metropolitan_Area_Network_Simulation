# Metropolitan_Area_Network_Simulation

1. The Purpose and Motivation of the Project 
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) allows sending and receiving of local emails
in a cheaper and quicker manner. Due to its use of fiber optics, users can transfer
databases and files quickly, as the speed of the network has the capacity of reaching
1000Mbps. This is why telephone companies across the world utilize the structure of
MAN and use fiber optics to transfer data in an unprecedented speed. MAN has the
feature of allowing network administrators to manage the entire network centrally
leading to much more effective and efficient network management. Speaking of
effective network management, it is always highly recommended to essential network
training beforehand. A MAN is also considered a more secure network in comparison
to a Wide Area Network (WAN).


2. Simulation Environment/Tool  
Cisco Packet Tracer simulations were used.
