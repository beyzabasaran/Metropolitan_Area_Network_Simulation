# Metropolitan_Area_Network_Simulation
<br />

**1. The Purpose and Motivation of the Project**

* Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) allows sending and receiving of local emails
in a cheaper and quicker manner. 

* Due to its use of fiber optics, users can transfer
databases and files quickly, as the speed of the network has the capacity of reaching
1000Mbps.

* This is why telephone companies across the world utilize the structure of
MAN and use fiber optics to transfer data in an unprecedented speed. 

* MAN has the feature of allowing network administrators to manage the entire network centrally
leading to much more effective and efficient network management. 

* Speaking of effective network management, it is always highly recommended to essential network
training beforehand. 

* A MAN is also considered a more secure network in comparison
to a Wide Area Network (WAN).

**2. Simulation Environment/Tool** 

* Cisco Packet Tracer simulations were used.
